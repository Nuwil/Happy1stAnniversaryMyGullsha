                <p>Hey, my love, we've made it this far. I know it was hard, but we'll keep moving forward together,
                    okay? I also know that I always say "I give up," "I'll leave," and many more things that aren't
                    what I really feel, but I hope you could understand me better next time because I'm having a
                    hard time as well understanding what I feel, and I don't know how to express my feelings well
                    towards you.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="slide three">
                <p>I hope we'll grow together and won't give up on each other again like we used to do. I don't want
                    to be sad on this wonderful day of ours, but I want you to know that I care for you a lot and I
                    love you so much. I'm sorry for letting you think I don't care about you, but the truth is I do
                    care about you. It's only a misunderstanding due to circumstances such as school schedules and
                    time zone differences.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="slide four">
                <p>I know we have our ups and downs; I hope we could always face it and overcome our downs; if not,
                    we can always call each other to face it together. I'm sorry, for this is all I can do for now,
                    but if you're here, I will buy us Shawarma, Ice Cream, Pasta, and Indomie, and I'll cook
                    everything for you, and we'll go out and <span>have some fun</span>, so everyone knows that you are mine.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="slide five">
                <p>I love you so much, and I will never ever leave you, and I will always stay here by your side as
                    always and as it should be always and forever and ever with Allah.</p>
